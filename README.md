# NextTrip2

## Project Overview

This project, titled NextTrip2, appears to be a mobile application designed to assist users in planning and managing their trips. Based on the file structure and technologies used, it leverages a combination of Java, JavaScript, Swift, and TypeScript for development, with a focus on utilizing React Native (Expo) for the client-side application.  While a comprehensive description was not originally provided, this extended README will extrapolate potential functionality based on the available code.

## Key Features & Benefits (Inferred)

Given the file structure, the application likely offers the following features:

*   **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup functionality, including password recovery.
*   **Place Details:**  Displays detailed information about specific locations, potentially including reviews, maps, and other relevant data.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** An "AIScreen" suggests that the application utilizes AI to provide personalized trip recommendations.
*   **Shopping Cart:** A "CartScreen" indicates the ability to add items (perhaps travel-related products or services) to a cart for purchase.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Built with React Native (Expo), implying support for both iOS and Android platforms.
*   **Customizable Themes:** The inclusion of `Colors.ts` suggests support for light and dark themes.
*   **Data Persistence:** Usage of local storage through `storageKeys.ts` for storing user data such as access tokens, profiles and user preferences.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before setting up and running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

*   **Node.js:**  A JavaScript runtime environment (version 16 or higher recommended).
*   **npm or yarn:**  A package manager for JavaScript.
*   **Expo CLI:**  A command-line tool for working with Expo projects. Install globally using: `npm install -g expo-cli`
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required for Android development.
*   **Xcode:**  Required for iOS development.
*   **Android Studio:** Required for Android development and emulators.
*   **Expo Go App:** Install the Expo Go app on your physical device or simulator to test your application.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the NextTrip2 project:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd NextTrip2
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Client Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Client
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the Expo Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    # or
    expo start
    ```

    This will open the Expo DevTools in your web browser.

5.  **Run on Device/Emulator:**
    *   **Android Emulator/Device:**  Follow the instructions in the Expo DevTools to run the app on an Android emulator or physical device. Ensure your emulator is running and configured correctly.
    *   **iOS Simulator/Device:**  Similarly, follow the instructions in the Expo DevTools to run the app on an iOS simulator or physical device.  You'll need Xcode installed.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

*   **Running the Application:** The `npx expo start` command starts the Expo development server and provides a QR code that can be scanned with the Expo Go app on your mobile device. This allows you to preview the application during development.

*   **Component Structure (Example):** The file structure shows components such as `LoginScreen.tsx` and `PlaceDetailScreen.tsx`.  These likely render user interface elements and handle user interactions related to login and place details, respectively.

*   **API Documentation:** No explicit API documentation is available in the provided information. It can be inferred that the API requests are handled within the React Native components using `fetch` or a similar library. If external APIs are being used, consult their respective documentation.

## Configuration Options

The `Client/constants/Colors.ts` file allows you to customize the app's color scheme, including light and dark mode settings.

```typescript
export const Colors = {
  light: {
    text: '#11181C',
    background: '#fff',
    tint: tintColorLight,
    icon: '#687076',
  },
  dark: {
    text: '#fff',
    background: '#11181C',
    tint: tintColorDark,
    icon: '#687076',
  },
};
```

Modify these values to change the application's appearance.

The `Client/constants/storageKeys.ts` file contains keys for local storage. While these constants themselves do not define configurable behavior, changing them will require changing the references in your code.
